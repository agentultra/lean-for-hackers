# Lean 3 For Hackers #

This is a guide to getting started using
[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io) 3 to write programs.  If you're a
curious sort that likes to explore new programming languages for fun
this guide is for you.  We will cover installing and setting up Lean,
the standard libraries, how to write programs using Lean, and where to
learn more.

## Installation ##

The best version of Lean available is the community fork at
<https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean>.  You can get binary
packages from the releases page or build from source.

I recommend building from source.  Make sure to add the built binaries
to your path and you're off to the races.

The two major editors for working with Lean are [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).  Both have supported
plugins that work well and offer full completion, jump to definition,
error hints, etc.

If you don't use one of those editors, Lean speaks
[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).  If you
can write a plugin for your editor be sure to share it.

That's all you need to get started.
